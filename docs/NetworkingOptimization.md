# networking optimization

this document provides guidelines for optimizing networking in the hft trading system.

## objectives

- minimize kernel overhead by leveraging kernel bypass techniques.
- achieve ultra-low latency in data transmission and reception.

## strategies

1. **dpdk/rdma integration:** in production, replace traditional sockets with dpdk or rdma to bypass the kernel and reduce latency.
2. **batch processing:** aggregate network messages to minimize per-packet overhead.
3. **poll-mode drivers:** use drivers that avoid interrupts to reduce latency variability.
4. **buffer management:** implement zero-copy buffering to reduce data copy overhead.

## future work

- integrate dpdk/rdma libraries for direct hardware access.
- implement asynchronous io with custom poll loops.
- continuously profile network latency and throughput to identify bottlenecks.
